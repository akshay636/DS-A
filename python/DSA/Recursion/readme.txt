Fibonacci Sequence:

Write a recursive function to find the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.
Factorial:

Implement a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a given integer.
Combination Sum:

Given a set of candidate numbers and a target sum, find all unique combinations of candidates that sum to the target using recursion.
Generate Parentheses:

Write a function to generate all possible valid combinations of n pairs of parentheses using recursion and backtracking.
N-Queens:

Solve the N-Queens problem using recursion and backtracking to place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard without them attacking each other.
Permutations:

Write a function to generate all permutations of a given array of distinct integers using recursion and backtracking.
Word Search:

Given a 2D board and a word, find if the word exists in the grid. You can move horizontally or vertically to adjacent cells, but not diagonally.
Subset Sum:

Given a set of positive integers and a target sum, determine if there is a subset of the integers that adds up to the target using recursion and backtracking.
Sudoku Solver:

Implement a Sudoku solver using recursion and backtracking to fill in the 9x9 grid following the Sudoku rules.
Palindrome Partitioning:

Given a string, partition it into substrings such that each substring is a palindrome. Return all possible palindrome partitioning of the input string.
Maze Solving:

Given a maze with obstacles, find a path from the start to the end using recursion and backtracking.
Letter Combinations of a Phone Number:

Given a digit string, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent on a telephone keypad using recursion
